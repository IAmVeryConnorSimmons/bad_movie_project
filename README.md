# bad_movie_project

Hi! If you're reading this...why?!?!?

Welp, I guess if you're doing it, I owe you an explanation. I like really bad movies. I love watching them with my friends and making fun of how terrible they are.

I would consider it a hobby. So I've created this project to house all my reviews of these bad movies and enable my friends to share their reviews with me as well.

I've got some ideas for how I can use this info to make the world a samer place. I'm going to try and flesh them out here.

So feel free to look around!

Oh and if you've seen a really terrible movie recently and want to review it, please visit the link below and share your experiences!
