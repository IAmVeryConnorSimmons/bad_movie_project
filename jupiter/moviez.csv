Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,2016,7,6,8,7,4,8,9,10,Sam Riley,"It's got everything. The dryness of a victorian novel, the tiredness of a zombie movie, and the plot strength of a child explaining their most recent dream.",Connor Simmons,0
Second Sight,1989,7,8,5,10,6,8,5,6,Bronson Pinchot,Bronson Pinchot hams it up as a goofy mystic with real psychic powers. John Laroquette is the straight man who just wants to exploit him. Together they form a terrible detective agency.,Connor Simmons,0

Season of the Witch,2011,6,5,8,9,5,8,8,7,Nicolas Cage,"Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman fight demons and think it's the most boring thing on Earth. But they don't sometimes? But I'm pretty sure they're bored, based on their tone.",Connor Simmons,0
Fantastic Four,2014,5,3,1,7,6,8,10,8,Miles Teller,A 150 million dollar mess. The movie's biggest theme is re-doing stuff. They remade a 10 year old movie. Then rewrote the script halfway through shooting. Then re-shot the second half of the movie six months later. The result is incoherence.,Connor Simmons,0
The Room,2003,7,8,1,10,8,7,3,2,Tommy Wiseau,"This movie is often viewed as the quintessential bad movie. If you haven't seen it, just do it. It's a work of art.",Connor Simmons,0
Troll 2,1990,7,7,3,8,6,6,4,7,George Hardy,"Tiny trolls come to a town to eat people, I think. Or just wreck houses with ooze? I'm not sure. No one is. This entire movie was shot as a standalone and then retrofitted as the sequel to Troll to cash in on Troll's success.",Connor Simmons,0

The Wraith,1986,6,4,4,9,5,7,7,5,Clint Howard,"Man, ok...So Nick Cassavettes and his gang openly rape and murder people but it all gets treated like they're harmless troublemakers in the 50's. Then Charlie Sheen comes back from the dead as a car/ghost who kills the gang members with...illusions? I'm not really sure. Clint Howard shines as the weirdest man on Earth",Connor Simmons,0
Robot Jocks,1989,5,6,5,9,6,4,4,8,Gary Graham,"Imagine if we prepared the world for Pacific Rim's Kaiju but the monsters never showed up. So then all the countries were like, ""well we've got all these robots lying around. Why don't we replace war with robot fights?""",Connor Simmons,0
Jaws 3,1983,7,2,6,4,6,8,4,10,The Shark,"Just like the original Jaws, but at Sea World. And it's rated PG. And Dennis Quaid has a love story. And the shark is just a normal shark without any scale, so it seems bigger. Other than that, they're practically the same movie.",Connor Simmons,0

Hellboy,2019,3,1,7,4,7,6,10,8,Mark Stanley,"This movie is weird. It doesn't really do anything wrong, it's just super unimpressed with itself. Like, every single actor just seems to have shrugged and said why not when offered the role.",Connor Simmons,0
Jack Frost,1997,6,6,2,8,3,7,3,6,Stephen Mendel,"Holy shit. Ok, so a serial killer gets oozed but instead of a teenage turtle he turns into a Snowman. But he's still one-hundred percent into killing people. Also puns. He loves puns and killing people. This is just...it's just great. Watch it.",Connor Simmons,0
The Great Wall,2016,4,3,5,7,1,7,10,7,Matt Damon,"Matt Damon goes to Medieval China on a business trip but, it turns out, so did a bunch of demons. Strap in because you're gonna forget this movie.",Connor Simmons,0
Skyscraper,1996,4,7,2,10,5,4,5,1,Anna Nicole Smith,Anna Nicole Smith answers the age-old question: What if Die Hard were a softcore pornography instead of a successful coherent movie?,Connor Simmons,0
Real Men,1987,6,4,6,9,2,6,6,3,Jim Belushi,"Jim Belushi is a secret agent, but suuuuper casual about it. Like, honestly, as a taxpayer I am uncomfortable with how casual he is about national security. He recruits John Ritter (I think as a practical joke) and they save the country...or Earth...was it the Universe? Something was gonna get destroyed and it didn't.",Connor Simmons,0
Hobgoblins,1988,7,5,1,9,4,3,1,3,Everyone,Remember Gremlins? You know how it made a lot of money? So do the people who made this. Imagine if someone told you about Gremlins 5 years after they saw it and then you had to make a movie based on their description. Boom. Hobgoblins.,Connor Simmons,0
Foodfight,2012,2,1,1,9,1,0,8,10,The Animation Team,"Yo, this movie cost 50 million dollars to make. Go google a screenshot from it. I'll wait...Right?!? It's insane. This movie grossed $76,000 in box offices. This is a tough watch, but if you're game it has some really stupid scenes.",Connor Simmons,0
Hard Ticket to Hawaii,1987,3,7,3,10,4,1,2,1,Ronn Moss,This movie has everything! A razor-blade lined frisbee. A semi-sentient snake run amok. Toxic masculinity. A guy doing a handstand on a skateboard. That same guy getting shot with a rocketlauncher. And a sick af theme song.,Connor Simmons,0
Soul Man,1986,5,6,9,5,3,1,6,1,C. Thomas Howell,"Imagine every person who complains about affirmative action in that way where you're pretty sure their racist, but you're not sure how they're being racist. Really toeing the line. This movie is their swan song. To say it does not hold up to the test of time is an extreme understatement.",Connor Simmons,0
Q The Winged Serpent,1982,0,1,2,6,1,2,5,7,Michael Moriarty,I have to confess something. I've watched this movie three times and I still don't know what's happening. I know there's a winged serpent. I know that Michael Moriarty is a bad guy. And I know that he should never do an accent again. That's all I know about this movie though. I consider this an expert-level difficulty movie.,Connor Simmons,0
Battlefield Earth,2000,7,7,6,9,5,4,8,7,John Travolta,Why do Christians get to be the ones who always have movies about them? Why can't scientologists get a movie about their religion? John Travolta is here to show you exactly why. Best part of this movie is John Travolta saying Man-animals over and over.,Connor Simmons,0
The Fanatic,2019,3,7,2,8,6,1,5,3,John Travolta,"Fred Durst, yes that Fred Durst, directs his first movie and wow. Just wow. There's a lot to unpack with this movie. John Travolta made me physically cringe a lot. This movie will leave you with a lot of questions. Questions which you should ask the people who, hopefully, watched this with you while you all get very drunk together.",Connor Simmons,0
Birdemic: Shock and Terror,2010,10,10,0,10,7,6,1,5,Alan Bagh,"There's a lot of debate among fans as to whether this movie was intentionally made to be so bad that it's good. I'm not sure where I stand, but it is indisputably a masterpiece of awfulness. Within the first 5 minutes of the opening credits, you'll  get a feel for just how beautifully awful a movie can be. A must watch.",Connor Simmons,0
